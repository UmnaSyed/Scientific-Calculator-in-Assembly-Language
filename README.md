This project is a menu-driven scientific calculator written in x86 Assembly (MASM).
It demonstrates structured programming, procedure calls, integer arithmetic, recursion, looping, user input/output handling, and matrix operations using the Irvine32 library.

The program allows users to perform multiple mathematical operations repeatedly until they choose to exit.
